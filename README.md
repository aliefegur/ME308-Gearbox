# Two Stage Gearbox with 1:35 Gear Ratio

This term project was developed within the scope of the ME 308 – Machine Elements II course given in the Faculty of Engineering at Izmir University of Economics. The main goal of the project is to develop a mechanical design of a two-stage gearbox according to the given working conditions and technical requirements. As group 9, the system assigned to us is Layout A. In this layout: there are helical gears in the first stage, and there are bevel gears in the second stage. The input and output shafts are located perpendicular to each other.

Under the project scope, our objective is to obtain power transmission from 4.0 kW and 1350 rpm input shaft to the output shaft that targeted to speed of 28-46 rpm. During this power transmission, gears, shafts, and bearings must be selected and dimensioned by considering strength and life criteria. Additionally, all components are designed with the aim of achieving the most compact system design.

In this study, varying mechanical engineering disciplines like determination of gear geometry and kinematics, calculating of the moments on the shafts, bearing reactions and stress analysis, suitable bearing selection, planning of assembly details. Also, the technical drawings and 3D models provided in the project supported the system’s producibility and applicability.
